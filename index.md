## About

<img src="/public/erik.jpg" alt="Erik Pettersson" class="profile-photo">

I'm a backend engineer who's spent 16+ years building systems that need to actually work at scale. Early employee at [Tink](https://www.tink.com) where I helped grow the engineering team and led payments infrastructure. Shipped code at [Apple](https://www.apple.com). Built [Dreamwod](https://www.dreamwod.app) from scratch as a solo founder.

I care most about the boring stuff - clean APIs, reliable data pipelines, systems that don't wake you up at 3am.

Based in Stockholm.
