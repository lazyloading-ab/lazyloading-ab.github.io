## About

<img src="/public/erik.jpg" alt="Erik Pettersson" class="profile-photo">

I'm a fullstack engineer who's spent 16+ years building systems that need to actually work at scale. Early employee at Tink where I helped grow the engineering team and led payments infrastructure. Shipped code at Apple. Built Dreamwod from scratch as a solo founder.

I care about both ends: clean APIs and reliable infrastructure, but also the UX details that make products enjoyable to use.

I also do CrossFit, sail a Mamba 34, and cross country ski when there's snow. Based in Stockholm.
